State of art after paper+data published

Before paper published
----------------------

Effort estimation of software tasks

* Quoting for external work

** Competing against others
** Bid low to win the contract, recoup by charging for unplanned work

* Internal project
** Not usually a competitive environment
** If estimate not accepted, other work available
** Impress management: estimate high, deliver under budget

Minuscule datasets

* Most less than 100 rows +
[small]'https://github.com/Derek-Jones/Software-estimation-datasets'
* Models: COCOMO, Putnam +
[small]'https://shape-of-code.com/2016/05/19/cocomo-how-not-to-fit-a-model-to-data/'
* Machine learning

Software effort estimation mostly fake research

Machine learning on minuscule datasets

Public datasets +
[small]'Public datasets Review of Existing Datasets Used for Software Effort Estimation, by Rahman, Gon√ßalves, Sarwar' +

* Albrecht 24 rows, 1980

Data explosion since 2019
-------------------------

{nbsp}

SiP effort estimation dataset

* One company's task estimate/actual over 10 years
* 10,100 unique tasks, 8,252 completed unique tasks
* 22 developers, 20 internal projects

{nbsp}

Agile

* Work broken down into small tasks
* Estimate/actual time
* Backlog of tasks

{nbsp}

Renzo Pomodoro dataset +
[small]'https://shape-of-code.com/2019/12/15/the-renzo-pomodoro-dataset/'

CESAW dataset
-------------

{nbsp}

Watts Humphrey latterly of Software Engineering Institute at CMU

* Team Software Process
* 45 distinct systems/companies
* 61,817 tasks

{nbsp}

New kinds of measurements

* Work Breakdown Structure
* Project staffing
* Fine grained time of event
** 203,621 time facts

Recurring behaviors
-------------------

{nbsp}

Human characteristics, i.e., not software specific

{nbsp}

Use of round numbers (heaping)

{nbsp}

Individuals consistently over/under estimation

{nbsp}

Accuracy intervals

{nbsp}

Priority queues produce power law waiting times

Round numbers
-------------

* Communicate a level of accuracy
* Cultural work intervals, e.g., 1-day
* Divisible by two, five, powers of ten +

After paper+data published
--------------------------

{nbsp}

Nothing changed in academia

* Still doing machine learning on minuscule datasets

{nbsp}

Replicated previous results

{nbsp}

Managers response

* "Sounds about right"
* Don't want to upset developers
** Easy for competent developers to find another job
** Expensive and time consuming to hire a developer

Analyse your data?
------------------

{nbsp}

* Do you have any human related software engineering data? +
Jira repo, project schedules, etc

{nbsp}

* Free analysis of your data +
Provided I can publish an anonymized version of the data +
